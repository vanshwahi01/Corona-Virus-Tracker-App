# Corona-Virus-Tracker-App
Corona virus tracker app with live data statistics with date and time.
I have written it in Python on Visual Studio Code.
It is to help people who cannot or do not wish to read the news or search the data online. With a simple click of a button, users can view live statistical data of the virus in the region.
